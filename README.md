# LoanOptions.ai - Task 2 (NodeJs) & Task 3 (SQL)

In this project, I have created a Nodejs application that gets data from an API, limits retrieved data, sorts it, and displays the transformed data.

As for the API used, I have identified that the API accepts the param for Category, thus improving the performance of our task. Furthermore, as the data was already sorted alphabetically, I reversed the array's order to achieve the requested order.

Moreover, in this project, we have the SQL task, and the file located for it is at the root of this project.

## How to run it?

### NodeJS
